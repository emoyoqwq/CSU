README
======

A. This package includes the following files. In your own readme file, modify the information as needed.

|-- Description PDF of the assignment
|-- README.txt [This file]


B. Use your designed makefile 
To compile the code and build the executable using the command 

systemprompt>  make

To remove the  executable files use

systemprompt>  make clean

To run the program use (assuming seed is 3) 

systemprompt> ./Starter 3

which will run the program and generate the outputs.


C. Answer the following questions (1 point each, select/type the right answer).

    1. Malloc allocates memory dynamically on heap? – True/False
    True.
    2. When dynamically allocating an integer array, Malloc takes the number of elements as the input? – True/False
    True
    3. free() is defined inside which header file? – _____________
     <cstdlib> header file
    4. How many executable(s) are required to be generated by the Makefile for this assignment? – _____________
    2
    5. What command is used to call the default target in Makefile? – _____________
    make
