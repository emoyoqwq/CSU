exp1: delete[] not called

exp2: x[10] is out of bound, and delete[] also should be there. I just change x[10] to x[0] and add delete[]

exp3: x was uninitialized

exp4: y was uninitialized before calling foo()

exp5: out of bound, char was initialized with 10 elements

exp6: should call delete[] after using greet

exp7: should use delete[]

exp8: should use delete[] free should be used with malloc

exp9: should be *a+=3 

exp10: there is not +- with unsigned int, so it can't get correct output, but it can be calculated
