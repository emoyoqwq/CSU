### Retrospective
#### Things that went well
Our group has been very understanding when difficulties arise. When team members are unable to commit as much time due to life circumstances or competing classes, the group has been very positive in the response and understanding.
#### Things we need to improve
We need to work better as a team on our work consistency and communication. The schedules for our team are extremely different, so mutual times to work on projects or hold meetings is extremely difficult. This means that using our team communication channels on Teams and Slack are going to be essential for our team success.
#### One thing we will change next time
Prioritize our communication on Slack and Teams to better coordinate our work on the project.
