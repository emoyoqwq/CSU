### Review

We were able to create the Login / Registration page, the Match page, the empty chess board on the Match page, the Database to contain Users and Matches, the API for Client and Server communication for Matches, the Database methods for the Server to communicate with the Database for the Matches, and all of the Classes necessary for Extinction Chess (like ChessBoard, ChessPiece, etc).
We did not get to creating the player profile and match history user interfaces, the API and Database methods for Users, or creating the Client functionality for playing the game.

### Retrospective

#### Things that went well
We got the majority of the platform outlined through our class diagram and how we plan to implement a lot of the functionality. We also got most of the barebones of the project created.
#### Things we need to improve
We need to work on being more efficient with our time. Due to inefficiency, we were unable to complete a few things we had planned on completing by this date.
#### One thing we will change next time
One thing we will change next time is continue to improve our communication with each other by asking for help as soon as we get stuck.
